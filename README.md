Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
It is a systematic application of the engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.


What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
  Software engineering is a systematic application of the engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems while Traditional programming is the process of writing code using standard programming languages to create software applications. The code written creates a specific instruction for a computer to follow. It involves defining every step and condition, leaving no room for the system to learn or adapt independently. 
It differs from the traditional programming in that;
  a) Software engineering focus on quality, realibility, maintainability and scalability while in traditional programming, it focus on writing and debuging code.
  b) software engineering uses structured methodologies i.e Agile, scrum, waterfall while in traditional programming, its methodology is simpler and often informal.
  c) Software engineering uses a broad scope which covers the entire software lifecycle while in traditional programming, it uses a narrow scope which is focused on coding.
  d) Software engineering had large team structure while in traditional programming has smaller team structure. 




Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
   There are six phases of the software development life cycle and they include;
   a) Requirements- this involves gathering and documenting the user needs as well as the system requirements.
   b) Design- this phase involves creatin of high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
   c) Implementation- this entails writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
   d) Testing- this is where tests are conducted to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
   e) Deployemensoftwaret- in this phase, the software is released to the customer.
   f) Maintenance- this is the last phase where support, updates and enhancements to the software are carried out.



Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
   a) Agile- it is a software development methodology which uses iterative and incremental approach.In this model, the developers can go to the next phase and they can come back incase of any changes. This is mainly preferred in the projects that are flexible and accomodates going back to make changes and improve.

   b) Waterfall model - it is software development methodolody that is uses sequential approach with distinct phases. In this model, one phase is completed at a time. the current phase must be completed to do the next one. For example implementation must be done before going to testing. This is mostly prefered in the projects that require completion of one phase before going to the next



What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
  Requirement engineering is a phase in the software development process that involves systematically identifying documenting and managing the requirements for the software system. It ensures that the final product meets the needs and expectations of its users.
  The importance of requirements engineering includes;
  a) Ensures a clear understanding of what the software should do.
  b) It helps to priotize requirements based on the stakeholder needs and the project goals.
  c) It facilitates handling changes in requirements during the project lifecycle.
  d) It provides a reference for developers and  stakeholders.
  e) It assesses the feasility of the requirements given the constraints.


Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

  Software design principles are guidelines that help the developers to create robust, maintainable and scalable software systems. These principles ensures that the software is well structured and easy to understand, modify and extend.

  Modularity is a fundamental concept in software design that enhances the manageability, flexibility, and robustness of a system. By dividing a system into well-defined modules, developers can build complex software in a more structured and efficient manner. Modularity in software design means breaking down a big task into smaller, manageable pieces, making it easier to build, understand, and maintain. This approach not only simplifies development and maintenance but also enables the system to evolve and scale over time.

  Modularity improves maintainability and scalability of software system.
    a) Helps in isolation of Changes- Updates in one module don't disrupt others.
    b) Ensures readability- Clear structure and design for easier comprehension.
    c) Reusability- Modules can be reused across projects, reducing redundancy.
    d) There is simplified testing- Independent testing of modules ensures reliability.
    In scalabilty thee is the following:
    a) Independent Development- allows teams to work on modules simultaneously.
    b) Flexible Upgrades- incremental scalability and seamless integration of new features.
    c) Load Distribution- efficient distribution of workload across modules.
    d) Adaptability- quick response to evolving needs through modular adjustments.


Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

   Testing in software engineering is the process of evaluating a software application or system to ensure that it meets specified requirements and behaves as expected.
   a) Unit testing- this testing involves testing individual components or modules of software.
   b) Integration testing- it involves tesing interactions between different components or subsystems.
   c) Acceptance testing- this testing involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
   Testing is crucial in software development because it helps identify defects and fix them, ensures quality, enhances user satisfaction and it saves time and resources.



Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
version control systems, are software tools that track changes to files and directories over time. They enable multiple users to collaborate on a project by managing different versions of files, keeping a record of changes, and facilitating collaboration among team members. 

They important in software development because of:
   
  a) History Tracking- it maintains a complete history of changes made to files.
  b) Collaboration- it enables multiple developers to work on the same project concurrently.
  c) Code Backup and Recovery- it serves as a backup mechanism for code, allowing recovery from issues.
  d) Branching and Merging- it facilitates parallel development efforts through branches.
  e) Code Reviews and Collaboration- it supports code reviews and knowledge sharing among team members.
